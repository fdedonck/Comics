# Figure1A
Two sci-art comics made for Figure1A. (This page might take some time to load because of the high-res images)

## Borrowed shade
How does extreme heat deepen social and spatial inequalities in cities? We follow a citizen of Lausanne navigating heat, resistance and the uneven burden of climate adaptation in cities. The work is set in an imagined future of intensified climate stress, where the right to shade becomes symbolic of the right to breathe. Nighttime temperature projections for Lausanne in 2060 are shown in the last panel.

## Silent Robber
This comic is based on my PhD at Universit√© de Lausanne where I study glacial erosion at the Gorner glacier (Zermatt, Switzerland).
The comic follows the seasonal life of a glacier as a quiet thief, eroding mountains and gives his plunder to rivers. The visual narrative is rooted in fieldwork on the Gorner Glacier, where erosion rate maps and melt-season data shape the story. As the ice thins and retreats, the question lingers: What can we still learn from glaciers as they disappear?
